/**
 * <b><u>AutoOptions</u></b> class is used to isolate the autonomous options mechanism from the main autonomous classes.
 * It handles displaying the choices and processing the choice made by the driver/coach and returning a boolean
 * (TRUE or FALSE) that indicates which choice was made.  This class is designed around two choices per option
 * but can easily be enhanced to use more than 2 choices.
 *
 * gamepad1 X and B buttons are used to make the selections, thus the need for the opMode to be passed in
 * when the class is instantiated.
 *
 * When using two choices a boolean value (TRUE or FALSE) is return indicating the choice made.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * The constructure for this class requires the opMode to be passed in, this allows the method to
 * utilize gamepad1 and telemetry.
 *
 * When adding methods, follow the pattern set by the current methods of setting up a selection array
 * of two, then call the makeSelection method, passing in the prompt and the selection array.
 * Finally, compare the returned integer to 0 and return the boolean value of the compare.
 *
 * Specific Methods
 * <ol>
 * <li>selectAlliance - allows the driver/coach to select the alliance (Red or Blue) </li>
 * <li>selectLocation - allows the driver/coach to select the location the robot is starting at (Depot or Crater)</li>
 * <li>selectDeployFromLander - allows the driver/coach to select if the robot is to be deployed or not from  (Yes or No)</li>
 * <li>selectionsGood - allows the driver/coach to verify that the selections made are good (Yes or No)</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Generalized Methods (should never need to be changed)
 * <ol>
 * <li>makeYesNoSelection - generalized method to handle those autonomous selections that are Yes/No</li>
 * <li>makeSelection - generalized method to handle the selection of</li>
 * </li>
